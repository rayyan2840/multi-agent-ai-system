# 🚀 Multi-Agent AI System: SpaceX Launch and Weather Tracker

## 📄 Project Description
This project is a **multi-agent AI system** that:
- Fetches the next SpaceX launch.
- Retrieves real-time weather data for the launch location.
- Summarizes whether the weather may cause a delay.

The system **plans, routes tasks between agents, and refines results step-by-step.**

---

## 🎯 Purpose
To demonstrate how a **planner-based multi-agent AI system** can:
- Break down a user’s goal into smaller tasks.
- Communicate between agents.
- Process real-world data through APIs.

---

## ⭐ Features
- Multi-agent AI system with **task planning and communication.**
- Real-time **SpaceX launch data.**
- Real-time **weather analysis** using OpenWeatherMap API.
- Weather-based **launch delay prediction.**
- Secure API key management using `.env` files.
- Simple **command-line interface.**
